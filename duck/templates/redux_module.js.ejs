/**
 * Calendar "ducks module"
 *
 * Rules:
 * A module...
 *
 * MUST export default a function called reducer()
 * MUST export its action creators as functions
 * MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE
 * MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a
 * published reusable library
 *
 * These same guidelines are recommended for {actionType, action, reducer} bundles that are shared as reusable Redux
 * libraries.
